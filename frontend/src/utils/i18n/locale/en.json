    "text": "Happy Paws was born many years ago due to the good predisposition of a woman in the city of Cordoba, Argentina. Our heroine is named Karina. She used to rescue stray dogs she found in her neighborhood: she fed them, treated their wounds and once they were healthy and strong, she gave them for responsible adoption. In March 2020, due to the mandatory quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a neighbor of Karina was stranded far from his home. As she lived nearby, a few days after the start of quarantine, he asked her if she could go to see his two female dogs. When Karina arrived at the house, the situation of the dogs was terrible. They were sad, alone and hungry. That day the shelter was born. Karina agreed to take care of these two dogs in exchange for bringing another stray dog to that place. There was no room for another dog in her house. So, she and the owner of the house joined forces. Her neighbors were touched and also started to help. In August 2021, Happy Paws had six volunteers. Today, the shelter has 18 volunteers, two shifts per day, three members per shift and operates from Monday to Monday. These 18 people make dogs' lives better: they clean the place, cut the grass, make their beds, wash their sheets, feed them, medicate them when needed, take them to the vet for their routine checkups, neuter them and take them for walks twice a day. They give them love, show them affection, take away their fears and make them trust humans again until each of them finds their new family."
